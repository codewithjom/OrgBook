* About

This may contain bunch of org-mode files that I wrote in Emacs. I created this for me whenever I am not online, I do love reading especially related to my needs. I really recommend to read this in Emacs because if you are an emacs user you already know what I mean.

- Official website of Org-mode: [[https://orgmode.org]]

*Note*: I also have a configuration of Emacs, you can also learn there because each line I put a description of what does the line of code do.
